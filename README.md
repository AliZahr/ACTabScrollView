ACTabScrollView
===============

A fancy `pager` UI extends `UIScrollView` with elegant, smooth and synchronized scrolling `tabs`.

DEMO
----

<img src="./screenshots/demo-1.gif" width = "288" alt="Demo" />
<img src="./screenshots/demo-2.gif" width = "288" alt="Demo" />
<img src="./screenshots/demo-3.gif" width = "288" alt="Demo" />

User can interact with this UI by some different gestures. The `tabs` and `pages` will scroll `synchronously`.

* `Swipe` pages normally
* `Drag` tabs can quickly move pages
* `Click` a tab to change to that page

You can also use `changePageToIndex` method to scroll page programmatically.
